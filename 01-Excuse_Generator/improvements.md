# Improving the excuse generator

## Introduction
There are a few ways that you could improve the excuse generator; these include increasing the number of items in the list, randomising the initial phrase and adding additional sentences.

## Number of possibilities
If you have 5 different elements in each of your lists you will have 5*5*5 = 125 possible excuses that can be generated. While this seems like quite a lot you will notice a lot of repetition if you run the excuse generator code a few times. Increasing the number of elements in each list to 10 will give you a possible 1000 excuses and you will see far less repetition.

There is no need to have the same number of elements in each list so you can extend each list as you think of new possibilities but leave the others unchanged.

## The Initial Phrase
The start of the excuse 
>> "I'm sorry I'm late but" 

could also be randomised. Think of options such as 
>>"Sorry I'm late mate but" or "Yo, dude, soz I is late but" 


and so on.

## Adding more sentences
You could try adding additional sentences such as 
>> "I tried calling the RAC but they wouldn't clear the cats". 

Here you have an organisation (RAC in this example), and action (clear in this example) and the object from the previous sentence (cats in this example).

## Your own ideas
Most written and spoken language has a fairly well defined structure. Although this can be extremely complex when you are dealing with a simple example like this you will only need a few rules for everything to make sense. Try thinking about how you speak, or write and come up with your own improvements. You could also research some natural language systems or language structure to see if that gives you any new ideas.
