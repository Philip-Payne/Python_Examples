'''
This is a fairly simple game to understand and reasonably simple to code but 
probably not the first project you want to attempt. 

The program chooses a randome number between 1 and 100 and the player has to
guess tha number.

The code consists of some setup and a game loop. The only way to get out of
the loop is for the player to guess the secret number
'''

##### Initial Setup #####

# Import any modules we will need
# Later we will want a random integer in a range 
from random import randint

# Explain how the game works

*                                             *
* Each time you guess you will be told if     *
* your guess is too high, too low or correct. *
