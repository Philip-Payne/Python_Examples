# Python Examples
A selection of Python examples for use in introductory modules. 

## Introduction
These examples are designed for those students who have no programming experience beyond the basic "Hello World" program. The examples are heavily commented, far more than would be necessary in a normal production environment. Each example is accompanied by a README.md that provides background information. 

## Pseudocode
These example are all described using pseudocode before moving on to the Python code. To keep things as simple as possible I have limited the pseudocode to a specific set of commands listed in the Pseudocode.MD document.

### Example 01 - The Randome Excuse Generator
A program to generate a random excuse for lateness. Always useful for academics and students alike. This example demonstrates the use of lists, importing modules, random selections and printing concatenated strings.

### Example 02 - Prime Number Checker.
The code checks if an integer is a prime number. The code demonstrates the use loops and the modulo operator as well as conditional statements and the creation of user defined functions. While the code demonstrates some interesting concepts the main point of this exercise is to consider the important of understanding the original problem before starting to code.

### Example 03 - Hangman Game
Code to play a simple game of Hangman on the command line. This example introduces the idea of 'state' in a program. There are a number of was that this code can be expanded to create a more fully featured game.

### Example 04 - Pattern Generator
No, this isn't fun but it is good practice for using loops and print commands. The main benefit of this exercise is to demonstrate some ways to plan your code.
